			<h1>LASHA BAKERY</h1>
			<p>
				Lasha - "baking in the desert" bakery, started its journey with home baking for several years, and then
				became a professional bakery. Today it is a boutique bakery, specializing in healthy breads, sourdough,
				wholemeal flours and slow processes using traditional techniques.
				We make sure to use the finest raw materials. The bakery is located in Mitzpe Ramon and over time the
				bakery became an integral part of the local landscape.
				The magic of baking has become an educational-experiential center of the world of bread. Groups come
				from Israel and abroad to attend enriching workshops revealing the technical, spiritual, historical,
				feminine and Jewish side of bread baking.
				The bakery shop is located at the front of the bakery. The store displays the magical abundance produced
				in the bakery and in addition, displays delicacies from boutique producers who create with love.
				You can relax at our seating area, and savor our delicacies :)
			</p>

			<p>You can visit the full Hebrew version of our website <a href="https://www.lashabakery.com">Here</a>.</p>

				Due to the war ongoing in Israel, we now provide the option to purchase bakery items to be distributed
				to soldiers, local families of soldiers who are currently serving, and displaced members of communities
				from the South of Israel who are now staying in Mitzpe Ramon.
				For example, the staff of the bakery could use 100NIS to provide a soldier with challah, rolls and
				pastries. Help us show our love and
				support.

			<p>NOTE: Payments are processed via an Israeli payment processing company, and therefore the form is in
				Hebrew and currency in ILS. It will ask for the Credit Card's number, expiration date, CCV an ID number (which can't be left
				blank, but any number will do), and name for billing.</p>

				Thanks for supporting Israel!
